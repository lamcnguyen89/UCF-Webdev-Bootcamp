# Group Projects 
 
 **Note: This applies to all projects throughout the course**

Group projects are an opportunity to show employers you have experience in collaborating with others to achieve a common goal.  You will leverage task management tools such as Kanban, Asana, or Trello, to organize work and get more done.  You exercise your communication skills by utilizing leading messaging services, ie: Slack or Google Hangouts.  Above all, you will gain practice working with others on the same repository.  By the end of the project you will understand the importance of branching and reviewing code before merging is complete.  The overall goal of each project is to build something awesome!
