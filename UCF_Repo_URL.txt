// The command to pull from UCF Repo is: "git pull https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp/UCF-ORL-FSF-FT-06-2020-U-C.git"
    
//But it's without the quotations

// The command order to push the changes I made from my local machine to the Repo on my User Account is:
     
	// "Git Status"
     
	//"Git add ."
     
	//"Git Commit"
     
	//"Git Push"



// There is alot of other shit to learn about Version control using Git, but I'll figure it out in time.


git checkout -b newbranchname: creates a new branch on the group repo. Name the branch after a feature.
git push origin homepage(or whatever the name of the branch we are working on is).
Everyone makes a new branch for everytime we build something new, work on that branch and then merge it in eventually to the master.

It is suggested that we delete that branch after we finish uploading the code for a specific feature into a branch for a specific feature.

Create a new branch for a new feature.

git checkout master : takes you to another already created branch
git checkout -b (branch name): creates a new branch

For a pull request be specific: For example, I want to get the title and description on the page for everyone else.


Branch Protection rules:
	Branch name pattern: *master
	Require pull request reviewa before merging
	Include Administrators

	another person on the repo will then have to approve the feature.

Always checkout to a new branch when working on a new feature.
